// 7.2 There is an 8x8 chessboard, if we remove the two pieces at diagonal corners, can you cover the rest of the board with 2x1 dominoes?
// Answer:
//	It is impossible. Let's supposed it is feasible, we can color each domino into black and white halves.
//	When the board is completely covered, there'll be 62 1x1 squares, exactly 31 white and 31 black.
//	Actually the two squares removed are in same color, thus you can't turn (30, 32) into (31, 31), however you tile them up.
