// 16.4 Design a class which provides a lock only if no deadlock would take place.
1. The class will maintain a list of all locks that would be requested by different processes.
	private Vector<Lock> locks;
2. The class will have a real-time record of which processes are using which locks. Mapping the process ID with a queue recording the locks it is using.
	private HashMap<int, Queue<Lock> > lockOccupations;
3. The class will perform deadlock detection before assigning a certain lock to a certain process.
	private bool deadLockDetection(int processID, int lockID);
4. The class will provide a public method to assign a lock to a process.
	public bool getLock(int processID, int lockID);

About dead lock detection:
	Generally, dead lock detection is about detecting a loop in a directed graph. Using DFS will be a solution.
