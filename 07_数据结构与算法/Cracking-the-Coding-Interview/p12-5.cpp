// 12.5 How would you test a pen?
// Answer:
//	1. A pen uses ink.
//	2. A pen usually writes on paper.
//	3. The volume of ink in the pen is usually small.
//	4. Sometimes when the pen is used for too long, we wash the pen with water and dry it.
//	5. When drawing ink from the ink bottle, we squeeze the ruber tube and releases it to draw the ink up into the pen.
// Above all the things, there are a few things to be tested:
//	1. the ruber tube which contains the ink.
//		1.a. is it elastic enough?
//	2. a very thin pipe, from which ink flows into the pen.
//		2.a. is it easily blocked?
//		2.b. does it break easily?
//	3. the upper cover, which protects the ruber tube inside it.
//		3.a. can the whorl fit tight?
//		3.b. is the cover firm enough? does it crack easily?
//	4. the tip of the pen, through which the ink flow out.
//		4.a. it is actually a pipe, does it block easily?
//		4.b. write it on different paper textures, does it write smoothly?
//		4.c. it is steel, does it rust easily?
