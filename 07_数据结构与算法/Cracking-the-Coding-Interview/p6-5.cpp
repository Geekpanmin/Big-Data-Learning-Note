// 6.5 Given 100 floors and 2 eggs.
// If the egg can sustain a dropping from nth floor, and will break for higher drop, please find a way to determine n, and minimize the number of droppings.
// Answer:
//	That's indeed a brain teaser with mathematical principle.
//	It just doesn't make sense to me, why it is optimized when num_of_drop(egg1) + num_of_drop(egg2) always stays the same.
// Perhaps you should read the book yourself. I do hope that I don't face such a question. Quite a teaser, tease me more.
