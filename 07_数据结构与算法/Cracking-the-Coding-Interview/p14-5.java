// 14.5 Tell me something about Object Reflection in java.
// Answer:
//	1. class type, constructor, member method, these are a few characteristics of a class
//	2. the Object Reflection is a collection of tool classes, it is able to handle the situation when you know you want certain behavior, but don't know exactly what type of class you need.
//	3. Unlike generics, it mainly deal with member methods and constructors, while generics focus more about data.
//	4. you may get a specific constructor, a member method with customized constraints.
