// 10.4 Assume you have a list of numbers. They range from 1 to N, where N is at most 32000. Some elements may have duplicates. You're given 4KB of memory, find out N and print the duplicates.
// 4KB means 32768bits, which is enough to hold 32000 numbers. Scan all the numbers and find out the duplicates.
// After the scanning is done, scan the bit vector to find the first '0' bit in the bit vector. It will be N.
